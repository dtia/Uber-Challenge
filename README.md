Uber-Challenge
==============
Coding challenge for Uber application. This app allows the user to create, read, update, and delete favorite locations which are also plotted on a map.

- favorites.py is made to run on postgres using SQLAlchemy, whereas favorites_local.py is made to run locally on SQLite.
- this does not keep track of user identity, so any favorite location logged will be seen by all other users
